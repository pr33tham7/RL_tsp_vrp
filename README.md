## To Run

1. Convert the simulated datasets into `.vrp` format files by running `RL_Dataset.ipynb` and download (automatically)
2. Download VeRyPy library from the link above and set up following its README
3. Run `run_heuristic.sh` with modified path and flag of prefered algorithm. Here we used `swp` for Sweep Algorithm and `ps` for Clarke & Wright
